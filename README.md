# Energy-efficient-routing-protocol-for-WSNs
A Comparative Analysis of GPSR and Dijkstra Algorithms

This repository contains the code for a simulation of a drone-assisted Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in urban areas. The project evaluates the performance of two routing protocols:

Enhanced GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing): Modified to incorporate energy-awareness.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Energy-efficient routing focused on static networks.

The code simulates random drone networks, applies dynamic topology changes (node additions, removals), and simulates obstacles (edge disruptions) to assess routing performance in real-world conditions.

Features

Dynamic Topology Changes: Simulation of node additions, removals, and connection updates.

Obstacle Disruptions: Random removal of network edges to simulate interference or failure.

Routing Algorithms:

GPSR Routing: Adapted to consider energy usage and routing efficiency.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Standard energy-efficient routing with computational trade-offs.
Visualization: Uses Matplotlib for visualizing network topologies, routing paths, and dynamic changes.
Performance Metrics: Includes success rate, energy consumption, routing time, and hop counts for both algorithms.
